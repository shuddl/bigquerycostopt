# BigQuery Cost Attribution Dashboard User Guide

## Introduction

The BigQuery Cost Attribution Dashboard is a comprehensive solution for analyzing, attributing, and optimizing your BigQuery spending. This tool helps you understand exactly where your BigQuery costs are coming from, detect unusual spending patterns, and implement cost-saving recommendations.

## Features

### Cost Attribution Module

- **User and Team Attribution**: Track costs across users, teams, projects, and query patterns
- **Hierarchical Cost Explorer**: Drill down from organization to individual queries
- **Cost Trend Analysis**: Visualize spending patterns over time with customizable time periods
- **Automatic Team Mapping**: Attribute users to teams for organizational cost visibility
- **Query Pattern Detection**: Identify costly query patterns and optimization opportunities

### Anomaly Detection

- **Statistical Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual spending patterns using z-score analysis
- **Machine Learning Enhancement**: Advanced anomaly detection using isolation forests
- **Forecast & Prediction**: Predict future costs and detect deviations from expected patterns
- **User Behavior Clustering**: Group users by similar spending patterns for targeted optimization
- **Real-time Alerts**: Get notified of cost spikes as they happen

### Recommendation Action Center

- **Prioritized Optimization Recommendations**: View cost-saving opportunities sorted by ROI
- **Implementation Workflow**: Preview, verify, and implement recommendations with safety checks
- **SQL Generation**: Automatically generate implementation and verification SQL
- **Impact Assessment**: Understand the potential impact before implementation
- **Implementation Tracking**: Track the status and effectiveness of implemented recommendations

### Visualization & Reporting

- **Interactive Timeline**: Visualize cost trends with anomaly highlighting
- **Custom Dashboards**: Create tailored views for different stakeholders
- **Exportable Reports**: Export data and insights in various formats
- **Retool Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with your existing Retool dashboards

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Platform project with BigQuery enabled
- Service account with appropriate BigQuery permissions
- Python 3.9+ for backend components
- Retool account for dashboard access

### Installation

1. Install the Python package:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Configure authentication:
   - Create a service account with BigQuery permissions
   - Download the service account key file
   - Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable

3. Set up the dashboard:
   - Import the Retool application from the provided JSON files
   - Configure the API endpoints in Retool
   - Set up team mapping (optional)

## Usage Guide

### Cost Attribution Analysis

1. Navigate to the **Cost Explorer** tab
2. Select the desired time period using the date range selector
3. Use the drill-down interface to navigate through the cost hierarchy:
   - Organization → Project → User → Query Pattern → Query
4. Filter results by team, cost threshold, or query type
5. Export reports for further analysis or sharing

### Anomaly Detection

1. Go to the **Anomaly Timeline** view
2. Select a time range and granularity (daily, weekly, monthly)
3. Identify highlighted anomalies on the timeline
4. Click on anomaly points to view details:
   - Deviation from expected costs
   - Contributing factors
   - Related queries
5. Configure alerts for future anomalies

### Using the Recommendation Action Center

1. Access the **Recommendations** tab
2. Filter and sort recommendations based on type, status, or potential savings
3. Review the details of each recommendation
4. To implement a recommendation:
   - Click "Implement" to start the workflow
   - Review the SQL and impact assessment
   - Verify the changes
   - Confirm and execute
5. Track implementation history and results in the History tab

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The system consists of:
- **Python Backend**: Handles data collection, analysis, and recommendation generation
- **BigQuery Storage**: Stores cost data, recommendations, and implementation history
- **Retool Frontend**: Provides the user interface and visualization components

### APIs and Integration Points

- **Cost Attribution API**: Retrieves and analyzes cost data
- **Anomaly Detection API**: Identifies and explains unusual spending patterns
- **Recommendation Engine API**: Generates and manages cost-saving recommendations
- **BigQuery API**: Executes implementation SQL and verification queries

### Custom Extensions

The system supports various extension points:
- **Custom Team Mapping**: Define your own user-to-team mapping logic
- **Alert Integrations**: Connect to Slack, email, or other notification systems
- **Custom Recommendation Types**: Add specialized recommendations for your environment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Data Access Errors**: Check service account permissions
- **Missing Cost Data**: Verify BigQuery audit logging is enabled
- **Recommendation Failures**: Check impact assessment for potential conflicts

### Logs and Diagnostics

- Backend logs are stored in the application's log directory
- Implementation history provides audit trails for all actions
- Error details are captured in the UI for failed operations

## Roadmap and Future Enhancements

The following features are planned for future releases:

- **Multi-project Comparison**: Compare costs across multiple GCP projects
- **Anomaly Classification**: Categorize anomalies by root cause
- **Custom Recommendation Rules**: Create your own recommendation rules
- **Integration with Terraform**: Implement recommendations via infrastructure as code
- **Advanced ML Models**: Enhanced prediction accuracy using more sophisticated models
