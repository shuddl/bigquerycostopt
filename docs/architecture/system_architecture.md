## Key Components

### 1. API Service (Cloud Run)

The API service provides HTTP endpoints for:
- Triggering dataset analysis
- Retrieving analysis results and recommendations
- Implementing recommendations
- Providing feedback on recommendations

**Technology**: Python + Flask, deployed on Cloud Run for serverless scaling

### 2. Message Broker (Pub/Sub)

Pub/Sub topics facilitate asynchronous processing:
- Analysis request topic
- Recommendation implementation topic
- Notification topic

**Technology**: Google Cloud Pub/Sub

### 3. Analysis Worker (Cloud Function)

The analysis worker processes BigQuery dataset analysis requests:
- Extracts metadata about tables and queries
- Analyzes storage, schema, and query patterns
- Generates optimization recommendations
- Stores results in BigQuery and Cloud Storage

**Technology**: Python, deployed on Cloud Functions

### 4. ML Enhancement Module

The ML enhancement module improves recommendations:
- Identifies patterns and anomalies
- Adds business context to recommendations
- Adjusts priority based on impact prediction
- Learns from implementation feedback

**Technology**: Python with scikit-learn, deployed as part of the analysis worker

### 5. Storage Layer

The storage layer persists all data:
- BigQuery datasets for structured data (analysis results, recommendations, implementation history)
- Cloud Storage for raw analysis data and ML models
- Secret Manager for sensitive configuration

**Technology**: BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Secret Manager

### 6. Dashboard (Retool)

The dashboard provides a user interface for:
- Viewing analysis results and recommendations
- Implementing recommendations
- Tracking cost savings
- Providing feedback

**Technology**: Retool (external)

## Data Flow

1. **Analysis Triggering**:
   - User initiates analysis via API or scheduled job
   - API service publishes analysis request to Pub/Sub
   - Analysis worker receives request and processes it

2. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - Analysis worker extracts metadata from BigQuery
   - Optimizer modules generate recommendations
   - ML module enhances recommendations
   - Results are stored in BigQuery and Cloud Storage

3. **Recommendation Implementation**:
   - User selects recommendation to implement via dashboard
   - Implementation request is sent to API
   - Implementation plan is executed using BigQuery jobs
   - Results are stored in implementation history

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - User provides feedback on implemented recommendations
   - Feedback is stored and used to improve future recommendations
   - ML models are periodically retrained with new data

## Security Controls

- Service account separation for each component
- Least privilege principle applied to all IAM roles
- Secret management for API keys and credentials
- VPC Service Controls for network isolation (production)
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

## Monitoring and Observability

- Cloud Monitoring dashboards
- Custom metrics for recommendation quality
- Alerting for system health and errors
- Audit logging for security events
- Distributed tracing for request flows

## Deployment Model

The system supports multiple environments:
- Development
- Staging
- Production

Each environment is deployed using Terraform with environment-specific configurations.

## Disaster Recovery

- Automated backups of BigQuery datasets
- State management for Terraform in Cloud Storage
- Infrastructure as Code for fast recovery
- Regular disaster recovery testing
